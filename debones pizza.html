The chain expanded rapidly and was acquired by Famous Brands in 1999.[4] The company has over 500 restaurants[3] in 14 countries mostly located in Africa including Botswana, Dubai, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Zambia and Angola .[5] The majority of its 546 (2018) restaurants are located in South Africa with 462 restaurants in the country. As of 2018 Debonair Pizza was the largest pizza chain restaurant in South Africa.</P>
